HTML file:

In body tag I created 3 inputs type="number"  for the user to insert numbers
 with the label names grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3.
 Next I created a button that calls a function in JavaScript to calculate the average of the 3 grades.
 Last I created an readonly input to show the result.

 See the comments as well.

JavaScript file:

There are only two functions. one $() to make calling document.getElementById(id) easier and shorter.
Second function to calculate the average score.

See the comments as well.

CSS file:

I created different types of input to design the differently.
input[type = number] has wight 30% of the screen, color an no border.

input[type = text] has wight 15% of the screen, color, font-size etc.

same goes for button and body.
