HTML file:

I named the application --> Future Value App

    In body tag I created h1 Future Value Application to show the name and inputs for the user to insert
the investment amount, rate to consider and the years. for the input wir id="result" I made it read only so the user
will not be able to insert anything. It is used to show the calculated result. I have to buttons: Calculate and Clear entries.



JavaScript file:

I this file I created few functions:
1. To calculate the result: getMoney()
2. To check if the user input is valid: is a number grater than zero :processEntries()
    if the input is not valid, there is alert and a message is shown to the user.
3. Clear entries: for the button Clear Entries

CSS file:

Here is the simple design for the website, like background color, font family, margin and etc.
Nothing special.
