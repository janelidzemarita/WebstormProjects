HTML file:

I named the application --> MPG APP

    In body tag I created h1 Calculate Miles per Gallon to show the name and inputs for the user to insert
the miles he/she has driven and the size of the tank. I made the input with id="MPG" readonly, so the user won't
be able to insert anything. It is used to show the result.



JavaScript file:

I this file I created few functions:
1. To calculate the result: calculateMpg()
2. To check if the user input is valid: is a number grater than zero :processEntries()
    if the input is not valid, there is alert and a message is shown to the user.
3. Clear entries: for the button Clear Entries, so the user can put new numbers.

CSS file:

Here is the simple design for the website, like background color, font family, margin and etc.
Nothing special.
