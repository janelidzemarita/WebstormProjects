HTML file:

I named the application --> Invoice

    In body tag I created h1 Your Invoice to show the name and inputs for the user to insert
the money he/she spent. I made the input with id="total" readonly, so the user won't
be able to insert anything. It is used to show the result.
    I also have Select and Option tags for the user to choose 1 of the two options I created: retail or wholesale. It is used
    to determine if the discount is 20% or 10%.



JavaScript file:

I this file I created a function: getPrice() to calculate the discount based on the options : retail or wholesale.



CSS file:

Here is the simple design for the website, like background color, font family, margin and etc.
Nothing special.
